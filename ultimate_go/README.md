- Code Reviews
- Integrity:
  - Be serious about writing code that reliable
  - Less code means less bugs
  - Error handling must be a part of the main code
- Readability: 
  - Not hiding the cost of the code or the decision making, the impact
- Simplicity: 
  - Hide complexity
- Performance: 
  - Compute less
  - Never guess
  - Measurements must be relevant
  - Profile
  - Test
